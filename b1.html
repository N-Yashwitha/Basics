        <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
        <p>The front end is a combination of two different elements: the graphic design (the look) and the user
            interface (the feel). Each of these is created independently, with most of the technical work going
             into the user interface using web languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
